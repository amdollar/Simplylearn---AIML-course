      "To maintain a lean physique while working out three times a week, focus on the following dietary strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prioritize Protein:** Aim to include a source of lean protein in every meal and snack. This helps preserve muscle mass while promoting fat loss. Opt for options like chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, legumes, and low-fat dairy. A general guideline is to consume around 0.8 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Control Portions and Caloric Intake:** Even healthy foods can lead to weight gain if consumed in excess. Use smaller plates to help with portion control and be mindful of your total caloric intake. Consider tracking your food intake with an app to better understand your eating habits and ensure you remain in a slight caloric deficit to promote fat loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Focus on Whole Foods:** Fill your diet with nutrient-dense, whole foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and seeds while limiting processed foods high in sugar and unhealthy fats. This not only provides essential nutrients but also helps you feel fuller for longer, which can aid in weight management.\n",
      "\n",
      "By adhering to these principles, you can effectively support your goal of maintaining a lean physique alongside your workout routine.\n"
