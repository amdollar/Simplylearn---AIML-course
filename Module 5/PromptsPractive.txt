Critique:
✅ What Works Well
Clear role assignment: “Act as a nutritionist” sets the right expertise.
Diet preferences are explicit: Vegetarian, Low Carb, High Protein.
Health constraint included: Limiting artificial sugar is a good, specific guideline.
Simple and easy to understand: No ambiguity in intent.

⚠️ What Can Be Improved
Grammar & flow
“one of my client” → should be “one of my clients”
Long sentence could be broken for clarity.
Lack of output structure
It doesn’t specify how the meal plan should be presented (table, bullets, daily split).
Missing personalization details
No info about age, goal (fat loss, muscle gain), region, allergies, or calorie target.
Time & portion clarity
Doesn’t specify number of meals per day or portion guidance.

Improved:

🔍 Prompt Critique
✅ What the Prompt Does Well

Clear topic
The subject (“Old age people health care”) makes the theme obvious.
Defined task
You clearly ask for a blog post explaining healthy practices.
Audience context
Targeting people who want their parents to be healthy is strong and helpful.
Constraints included
Word count (600–700 words)
Tone (encouraging, easy to follow)
Specific content elements (physical activities, diet plans, timetable)
⚠️ Areas That Need Improvement
1. Grammar & phrasing
“Old age people health care” → awkward phrasing
✔ Better: “Elderly Health Care” or “Healthy Aging Practices”
“old age/ adult audience” is unclear and overlapping.
Long sentences without punctuation reduce clarity.
2. Structure clarity
Subject, Task, Instructions, and Context are all written in one block.
Separating them cleanly improves readability and AI understanding.
3. Output format not specified
You mention a timetable but don’t explicitly request a table format.
No guidance on headings, sections, or layout.
4. Scope of “diet plans” is vague
Is it a full weekly plan, daily sample, or general guidelines?
5. Tone control could be stronger
Encouraging is good, but adding words like empathetic, non-preachy, or practical improves results.
