      "Your birth chart paints a picture of a spirited and intelligent individual, driven by a strong desire to make your mark on the world. With your Sun in Aquarius, you possess an innovative and forward-thinking mind, often seeing beyond the conventional. The precise time and location of your birth place you firmly in **Aquarius rising**.

      "*   **Friendly and Sociable:** You enjoy being part of a community and can form connections with a wide range of people. However, true intimacy might be something you approach with a certain level of independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your Aquarian energy fuels a desire to innovate and bring about positive change. You are a natural problem-solver, often finding unconventional solutions. Embrace your unique perspective, Anurag, as it's your greatest gift.\n",
      "\n",

You may express affection through acts of service or by building something lasting together.\n",
      "*   **Mars in Sagittarius:** This placement fuels your drive and energy with a spirit of adventure, optimism, and a quest for knowledge. Your actions are often bold, enthusiastic, and guided by a philosophical outlook. You are eager to explore new ideas and experiences, and you have a strong sense of justice. However, be mindful of potential impulsiveness and the need to follow through on your energetic pursuits.\n",
      "*   **Jupiter in Capricorn:** Jupiter here brings expansive opportunities and growth through discipline, hard work, and a structured approach. You are likely to find success through practical endeavors, building a solid foundation, and demonstrating leadership. You have a strong work ethic and a deep understanding of responsibility. This placement can bring a sense of gravitas and authority to your endeavors.\n",
      "*   **Saturn in Aries:** Saturn in Aries signifies lessons around taking initiative, assertion, and leadership. You may have experienced challenges or a sense of caution in asserting yourself or taking bold action. However, with maturity, you learn to channel this energy into disciplined and pioneering efforts. You are learning to build courage and take on responsibility for your own ventures.\n",
      "*   **Chiron in Aquarius:** Your Chiron in Aquarius highlights a deep wound related to belonging, individuality, and societal acceptance. You may have felt like an outsider or struggled to fit in. The healing path lies in embracing your unique gifts, using your innovative spirit to help others find their place, and becoming a bridge between different groups. Your unique perspective is your strength, and by sharing it, you can heal yourself and others.\n",

      "*   **Build Meaningful Connections:** Your Venus in Capricorn suggests you value deep, committed relationships. Focus on building these with individuals who share your vision and values. Be patient and invest time in nurturing these bonds.\n",
